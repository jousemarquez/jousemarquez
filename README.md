As a Web Development student, my journey has just begun ⛏️, starting from the basics of coding.

Over the past decade, my career has revolved around content production, encompassing roles such as a writer, web editor, blogger, manager of social media accounts, project overseer, and creator of audiovisual content for YouTube and Twitch. During this time, I've had the privilege of collaborating with clients from both domestic and international backgrounds, including countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, and Russia, among others. Throughout my professional life, English has served as my primary means of communication.

I thrive on being a self-directed learner, constantly immersing myself in content that enriches my professional profile. This perpetual quest for knowledge drives me to continually acquire fresh techniques and approaches to enhance my work.

## Onikami Games

![https://onikami.com/](https://github.com/jousemarquez/Marcas/blob/main/onikami.png)

Onikami (*oni + kami*) Games emerged in early 2013 as the embryo of an independent game development studio. After an exciting first year, during which we published our initial works, we had to abandon the project due to professional and personal reasons of the 3 team members.

Currently, we work on blockchain game development with **Siege of Mytra** and the creation of smart contracts for commercial purposes.
